# Bankist-javaScript  <br /> <br />
 
Please note, the HTML and CSS in this project is not mine. I made this project as a part of an online javaScript course. The HTML and CSS in this project belongs to the instructor, Jonas Schmedtmann. However, I coded the javaScript by myself. <br /> <br />
A minimalistic dynamic, but static web application, developed using JavaScript, which demonstrates a bank interface allows <br /> <br />
users to transfer money to different accounts, request loan, logs out the user automatically after certain time of inactivity, <br /> <br />
and allows users to close the existing account. <br /> <br />
• Uses Objects and arrays to store the data locally within the application, no external database, and updates the
state of the application as instructed by the user. <br /> <br />
• Uses functional paradigm of JavaScript to carry out the operations and uses array methods such as filter, map, find
etc. <br /> <br />
• Uses even listeners, DOM methods and properties to carry out the DOM manipulation and update the html and
CSS accordingly upon user interactions. <br /> <br />
