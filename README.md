# myProjects

This repository contains some of my projects that I have built in the past few months, after I graduated, and some projects that I have built as part of class assignments in the college. <br/><br/>
"forkify" and "Sikhism" are more complex than Bankist and Checkers. You'd definitely like to look at "forkify" and "Sikhsim". <br/> <br/>
Every project folder has a README.me file which gives a breif overview of the project such as what technologies have been used to built them and what are their features.
